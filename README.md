# MIcroDI - A ChatGPT made MIDI-micro:bit JS converter
## Why I made it
###### In 2020-2021, when having **_Zoom lessons_**, I found that the school-controlled iPad has micro:bit app, and I had an idea making micro:bit music, but that needs much time so I used to try to make the converter, but I didn't have any programming skills (only basic HTML) so I gave up...

##### In late 2022, ChatGPT is introduced but I didn't use it to make this at the start. I just used it to do my HTML code for the other school project. At last week (19/6/2023), I suddenly remembered this idea and I used GPT to do it, the talking history are at the end of this README
